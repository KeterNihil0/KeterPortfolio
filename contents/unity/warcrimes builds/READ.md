# Intro:
 "Warcrimes - The Game" Is a satirical multiplayer roleplaying game I was working on between 2019 and 2021. Taking heavy inspiration from games such as Space Station 13, Minecraft and Metal Gear Solid V, alongwith a graphical style inspired by Space Station 13 and the Gameboy console. Unfortunately betweendiminishing interest and conflicts with personal life, the game and it's builds act moreso as prototypes and proofs of concepts.
# Goals:
 The goal of Warcrimes was to have several hour long rounds as 10+ people filled different roles within aprivate military corporation (PMC) base, ranging from janitorial roles (Cleaning messes), R&D scientists(Developing new technologies, often legally questionable), peacekeepers (Acting as security in the base),cooks, and more. There would however be conflict in the form of United Nations Inspectors who are to makesure the PMC is abiding by international laws regarding warcrimes, whilst also dealing with competing other PMC spies who wish to steal the findings and technology of your PMC.
